# Dormease - Hostel Management System

Dormease is a web-based application designed to automate and streamline the hostel accommodation process at IIT Patna during academic programs like campus immersion. It features automated room allotments, student check-ins, and real-time updates, aiming to reduce administrative overhead and improve student experience.

## Features

- **Automated Room Allotment**: Room assignments based on alphabetical sorting and custom rules.
- **Digital Check-In System**: Students can check in using QR codes, minimizing physical queues and delays.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Room availability and updates are sent instantly via email or app notifications, keeping students and admins informed.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Provides real-time statistics on room availability, student registrations, and hostel occupancy. It uses visual elements such as Donut graphs and counters for better decision-making.
- **Student Verification**: Each studentâ€™s identity is verified before allocation to ensure proper registration.
- **Issue Tracking**: Hostel-related issues (plumbing, inaccessibility, etc.) can be logged and tracked for timely resolution.
- **Scalability**: Currently web-based, but designed to scale with future extensions into mobile apps and QR-code-based services.
- **AI-Powered Error Handling**: Uses the OpenRouter API for intelligent error handling, including managing name typos during verification.
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub are used for version control, ensuring smooth team collaboration.
